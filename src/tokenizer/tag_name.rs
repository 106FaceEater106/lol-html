//! All standard tag names contain only ASCII alpha characters
//! and digits from 1 to 6 (in numbered header tags, i.e. <h1> - <h6>).
//! Considering that tag names are case insensitive we have only
//! 26 + 6 = 32 characters. Thus, single character can be encoded in
//! 5 bits and we can fit up to 64 / 5 â‰ˆ 12 characters in a 64-bit
//! integer. This is enough to encode all standard tag names, so
//! we can just compare integers instead of expensive string
//! comparison for tag names.
//!
//! The original idea of this tag hash-like thing belongs to Ingvar
//! Stepanyan and was implemented in lazyhtml. So, kudos to him for
//! comming up with this cool optimisation. This implementation differs
//! from the original one as it adds ability to encode digits from 1
//! to 6 which allows us to encode numbered header tags.
//!
//! In this implementation we reserve numbers from 0 to 5 for digits
//! from 1 to 6 and numbers from 6 to 31 for ASCII alphas. Otherwise,
//! if we use numbers from 0 to 25 for ASCII alphas we'll have an
//! ambiguity for repetitative `a` characters: both `a`,
//! `aaa` and even `aaaaa` will give us 0 as a hash. It's still a case
//! for digits, but considering that tag name can't start with a digit
//! we are safe here, since we'll just get first character shifted left
//! by zeroes as repetitave 1 digits get added to the hash.

// NOTE: unfortunately `static fn` is still unavaliable in stable,
// so we need to use manually precalculated values in this enum.
// Consistency between hashing algorithm and these values is guaranteed
// by the dedicated test.
